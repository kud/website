## 🌟 Features

- 🔗 **Real-time rooms** — a tiny [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/) room server on Cloudflare's edge keeps everyone in sync over WebSockets; rooms survive host refreshes and reconnects
- 🎟 **Friendly room codes** — six-character codes (e.g. `PKD8QC`) that are easy to read out loud or paste in chat
- 🃏 **Multiple deck presets** — Fibonacci (0–21 + ? + ☕), Numeric, T-shirt (XS–XXL), or a fully custom deck; your favourite is remembered for next time
- 🎰 **Casino-style reveal** — votes stay face-down on the felt until the host flips them all at once
- 🎤 **Speaker ritual** — after the reveal, pass the mic: highest vote explains first, lowest second, then the rest; <kbd>space</kbd> drives the whole flow
- ⌨️ **Hotkeys** — <kbd>1–9</kbd> to vote, <kbd>space</kbd> to reveal / next speaker / new round
- 🤵 **A table with a soul** — a pixel croupier announces rounds and commentates results, a waiter delivers coffee when someone plays ☕, and a cat wanders by (it purrs if you're lucky)
- 🔊 **Subtle sound design** — synthesized card swishes, reveal flips, consensus chimes; one-click mute, persisted
- 🎭 **Pixel-art avatars** — DiceBear-generated, selectable on join and changeable mid-session
- 🎉 **Consensus confetti** — fires automatically when everyone votes the same value
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly & installable** — a roster layout on phones and a PWA manifest for Add-to-Home-Screen
- 🌗 **Dark & light theme** — toggled with a single click, preference persisted across sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/kud/planning-poker.git
cd planning-poker
npm install

# Start the PartyKit room server and the Next.js dev server
npm run party:dev   # terminal 1 — ws://127.0.0.1:1999
npm run dev         # terminal 2 — http://localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

1. Click **Create room** — a six-character room code and shareable link are generated instantly.
2. Share the link (or code) with your team.
3. Each guest opens the link, picks a name and avatar, and joins.
4. Everyone votes; the host clicks **Reveal** to flip all cards simultaneously.
5. Celebrate consensus with confetti, or discuss and re-vote.

## 🧩 How It Works

```
Host    ◄──────────────┐
                       │ WebSockets
Guest 1 ◄──────────────┤
Guest 2 ◄──────────────┼──► PartyKit room server (Cloudflare edge)
Guest 3 ◄──────────────┘    └── authoritative room state
```

Each room is a stateful [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/) server running on Cloudflare's edge (free tier). Every participant — host included — connects over a WebSocket; the server holds the authoritative room state and broadcasts every change to all connections. The deck and host identity are persisted in room storage, so the room survives refreshes and reconnects.

Hosting is a capability, not a page: creating a room generates a secret kept in `localStorage`, and whoever presents it to the room server gets the host controls. No accounts, no database.

### Routes

| Route        | Purpose                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/`          | Landing page — create or join a room |
| `/room/[id]` | The room — vote and watch results    |

### Deck Presets

| Preset    | Cards                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Fibonacci | 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ?, ☕             |
| Numeric   | 1 (XS), 2 (S), 4 (M), 8 (L), 16 (XL), 32 (XXL) |
| T-shirt   | XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL                           |
| Custom    | Comma-separated values of your choice          |

`127.0.0.1:1999` in development and `planning-poker.kud.partykit.dev` in
production builds.
