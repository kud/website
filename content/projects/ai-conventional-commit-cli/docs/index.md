description: "🤖 AI Conventional Commits that learn your repo's style — generate, split and refine messages"
---

---

Reads your staged diff, learns your repo's commit style, and produces Conventional Commits-compliant messages — one polished commit, or a cleanly split series. Provider-agnostic: OpenCode-routed models, the Claude CLI, or the Anthropic API.

- 🤖 **AI-generated conventional commits** from your staged diff
- ✂️ **Smart commit splitting** into atomic, selectively-staged commits
- 🎨 **Gitmoji styles** — `standard`, `gitmoji`, and `gitmoji-pure`
- 🔒 **Privacy-aware diff filtering** — three tiers control what's sent to the model
