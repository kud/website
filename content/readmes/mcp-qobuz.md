## Features

- **AI-native Qobuz access** — exposes Qobuz to any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) as tools.
- **Search & lookup** — search albums, artists, and tracks; fetch full details for any track, album, artist, or playlist by ID.
- **Browse your library** — list your favourited tracks, albums, and artists, and all your playlists.
- **Now playing** — read the current track from the Qobuz desktop app (macOS only — the server must run on the same Mac).
- **Flexible auth** — Keychain locally, or `QOBUZ_TOKEN` / `QOBUZ_APP_ID` env vars for headless and remote MCP hosts.
- **Guarded writes** — create playlists, add tracks, and update descriptions, gated behind an explicit `confirm` flag.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g @kud/mcp-qobuz
```

## Usage

Add the server to your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-qobuz": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@kud/mcp-qobuz"] }
  }
}
```

### Auth — local macOS (Keychain)

Credentials are read automatically from the macOS Keychain using the same `"qobuz"/"default"` entry written by `qobuz-cli`. Log in once with `qobuz login` and this server picks them up — no extra configuration needed.

### Auth — headless / remote (env vars)

For CI, remote MCP hosts, or any non-Mac environment, pass credentials via the `env` block in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-qobuz": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@kud/mcp-qobuz"],
      "env": {
        "QOBUZ_TOKEN": "your-token",
        "QOBUZ_APP_ID": "your-app-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Env vars take precedence over the Keychain when both are present.

> **Note:** the `now-playing` tool is macOS-only — it reads the player state file written by the Qobuz desktop app. It will return an error on any other platform.
