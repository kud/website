    description:
      "Everything is a workflow or a pipeline to me — a feature is connected to other features, and to how the team works. I see systems everywhere, in how I work and how I build, and I love thinking in design systems. I work at a higher level: not just the thing we're building, but the system it lives in.",
  },
  {
    label: "Language & meaning",
    description:
      "I'm a linguist at heart: coding is a language, not maths. I'm into terminology and detail, and I need meaning in what I do — in what we build, what we believe, and how we work together.",
  },
  {
    label: "User empathy",
    description:
      "I start by listening — to users and to stakeholders — because the point is to deliver something genuinely meaningful to them, not just to close a ticket. I'd rather resolve the real need straight away and then polish, than chase a perfect plan that delivers what we assume the user wants — which often isn't what they actually need.",
  },
  {
    label: "Design & product partnership",
    description:
      "My best work happens with designers and PMs, and I learn the basics of each discipline so we genuinely speak the same language. The design review is honestly my favourite meeting — I want to shape the solution together before a line of code is written.",
  },
  {
    label: "Shape Up & iteration",
    description:
      "Inspired by Shape Up. I used to be a handcraft developer; now I'm about optimising systems and the right constraints — the need, the appetite, adjusting the plan as we learn. I treat every feature like a startup: an MVP that already works, then v1, v2, v3 — each version usable on its own, improving piece by piece instead of waiting for the whole thing to come alive at the end.",
  },
  {
    label: "Developer experience",
    description:
      "I see developers as users too — that's why I love DX so much: my users are the engineers, and I want to facilitate their work. I believe in reducing cognitive load for everyone — users, engineers, and the PMs and designers around them — with better tooling, conventions, automation, and design systems.",
  },
  {
    label: "AI-assisted engineering",
    description:
      "What I love most: architecting the solution, then delegating its execution to AI in a deliberate, fine-tuned way — turning experience into agents and skills that keep getting sharper.",
